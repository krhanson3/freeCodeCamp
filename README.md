# freeCodeCamp
freeCodeCamp is a free online website that allows users to practice different programming skills and gain verified certifications. This repo contains my work on their core curriculum.  

Responsive Web Design
  - This course teaches HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design. Though there are 20 projects
    in all, I've included the ones I feel best display the overall skills I've gained through this course. I haven't completed the course
    yet but I hope to have it finished soon.
